# Using this feature is *NOT* recommended. Instead, use the `keystone-manage

# that can be used to bootstrap Keystone through the API. This "token" does not
# represent a user (it has no identity), and carries no explicit authorization
# (it effectively bypasses most authorization checks). If set to `None`, the
# value is ignored and the `admin_token` middleware is effectively disabled.

# automatically treated as `http://server:5000`. You should only need to set
